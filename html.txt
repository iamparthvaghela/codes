Nomeclature of files & folders
	- completely in lower case
		- some server might be case sensitive 
	- don't use whitespaces( rather use hyphen(-) than underscore(_) )
			- google search engine treats (-) as whitespace and not (_)
		- some server might think that added space means two files
		- other may put % in place of whitespace (the character code for spaces in url)

- Any web dev project should look like
	- index.html
	- images -> folder
		- all the images on the site
	- styles -> folder
		- css file
	- scripts -> folder
		- js files

- if image in same directory
	- image.html
- if image in sub-directory
	- sub-directory/image.html
- if image in prev director
	- ../image.html
- use combinations of all these to traverse through directories
														
html - hypertext markup language
opening tag closing tag ( content in between)

- we can also write <html attr = atrrvalue > yes!!! without any double quote (if it doesn't contain ", ', `, = , <, >)
	- but not advisable 

- Nesting of elements is also possible

- <!DOCTYPE html>
	- around 1991/ 92 doctypes were meant to act as a links to a set or rules that a html page needs to be followed
		- to be considered as good html
		- automatic error checking !!
	- today no use, maybe to specify the version of html
- <html>
	- it encloses all the content of your entire page
		-also known as root element

- <head>
	- all info about page that you don't want the user of the page to see

- <title>
	- name displayed on tab

- <body>
	- content of your page visible to user

<h1> to <h6> high to low
	- don't just use this to increase size of a text in your website
		- bcoz this is the thing that is read in screen reader first as heading
		- also the heading is used to index your site on search engines( rank  ( so do it carefully)


<br> for a new line

<hr size = "3" noshade >


<head>
-contains title and meta data about the web page
	- meta charset  = "UTF-8" 	// page is encoded using UTF-8
	- meta name = "description" content = "free html tut" 	// for search engines		// also shown on search page as a description
	- meta name = "keywords"
	- meta name = "author"

- use <em> tag rather than <i> tag
	-because <em> stresses the text while <i> only makes the appearance of text to be slanted

- use <b> to make the text bold
	- use <strong> rather than <b> for the same reason

-use <p> to create a paragraph that starts from a new line

- <ul>		--> for unordered list
- <ol start = "7" type = "i">		--> for ordered list 
- <li> for list item
	- we can also have nested list 

-use <img src = "link" alt = "alternative text if image is not found" height and width >
	- alt text for
		- visually impaired ppl
		- if image cannot be loaded
	- while picking image from chrome use-> tools, license -> creative commons license

- use <a href = "link"> for going to another link 
	-it'll be purple if visited and blue if unvisited
	- try to make sure that "link" contains http:// or https:// part, otherwise might produce unexpected results
	- href -> hyptertext referene
- <table>
	<thead>		// for identifying the column names during styling or scrolling
	<tbody>		//  ofc the main body of the table
	<tfoot>		// below the body part
	- <tr> for creating a row 
	- <th> for table head 		// deafult is bold
	- <td> for table data 		// not bold

- <form disabled>		// basically sends the name = value pair for all input elements present inside
	- to take input from user

	-<input type = "button">		// provide an action using javascript
		-<input type = "button" value = "click me"> 		// the text displayed on button
		-<input type = "button" disabled>		// disables the button
		-<input type = "button" accesskey = "k"> 	//press alt + s to trigger the button 	// diff for diff. browser and machines
								// generally advised not to use accesskeys
								// if more than one values are provided, then the first working value will be considered
	-<fieldset> is used to group various parts of a form-->for styling purposes
		- <legend> is used to label those group
		- gets a border type around the fieldset elements
		- <fieldset disabled> --> all the contents inside are no longer editable and cannot be submitted
			-the form elements inside legend won't be disabled*******
		- <fieldset form = "form_id"> 	For some reason this isn't seem to work
						-- basically to link fieldset to a form in other part of the document

	- <element autofocus> 		// the element to focus on when the page first reloads
					// if more than one element is made autofocus the first element will be focused
					// it isn't just for form but can also be applied for other things
					// carefully apply because may lead to scrolling of page on loading first
					// may lead to opening screen keyboard on touch devices
	
	-<button> and not <input type = "button">
		- is by default submit when no type is mentioned
		- because using BUTTON allows more rendering capability(adding images and text and paragraphs in between the button tags
		<button type = "submit" form = "id_of_form">		// for submitting a form of given id	//similar to fieldset linking
		- <buttont type = "reset">
		- <button type = "button"> 	// an event handler code is needed 
		- <button type = "submit">	// be careful to mention type because by default it is submit


	- <label> for associating an input element with a text
		- clicking on label will focus on the input field(improves focusing on devices with small screen)
		- helps assistive technology user(basically disabled people)		// by reading out the label text
		- <input id = "xyz">	&& 	<label for = "xyz">
		- Nested labelling
			<label> Are you above 18? 		// if still want to put 'for' attribute, it must be same as the conatined input element
				<input type = "checkbox">
			</label>
		
	- <div> --> doesn't do much in pure html, but makes styling easier in css

	- <input type = "checkbox" name = "abc" value = "xyz"  checked OR unchecked>		--> for either checking or unchecking
		- name = value --> this pair is sent when submit button is clicked
			- no pair is sent when unchecked or in indeterminate form
			- if no value is mentioned, then 'on' is sent by default to the server
		- <input type = "checkbox" checked> --> makes the default value checked			// doesn't change when the user interacts with checkbox, just the inital state of checkbox
		- 'indeterminate' is an attribute with not checked or unchecked but no browser supports it in html, although it can be set up via javaScript
			- is represented by a square box with - sign
			- for nested checkboxs
		- use <fieldset> for handling multiple checkboxes with same name i.e multiple choices 
			- use same name for all checkbox
	*****************
	Does submit button outside fieldset submits input data inside fieldset? Bcoz it isn't working for me
	****************
	
	-<input type = "color" value = "#ffffff"> 	--> strictly in hexadecimal format
		- default value is '#000000' i.e. black
	
	- <input type = "date">
		- value is of type DOMstring of type 'YYYY-MM-DD'
		- min = 'YYYY-MM-DD' and max = 'YYYY-MM-DD' is the range within which the date must be entered
		- step = "days" --> basicaly only allow dates after "days"	
		-e.g when step = 5 and value = "5 june", then next selectable value will be 10 june and 15 june and so on 
			- when user enters an invalid date, it is rounded off to the nearest vaild date, and to positive side if equal from back and front

	- <input type = "datetime-local">
		- this may not necessarily be user's local date and time
		- 'YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm'  	--> value is of the form
		- min , max for range of date and time
		- step  for stepping time in seconds 
			- when invalid text is entered by user, then rounded to nearest valid value
		- generally use javascript's jquery date picker and jquery timer plugin 
			- because of cross compatibility issues && regionwise change in this text pattern(e.g. mm.dd.yyyy, dd-mm-yyyy)
			- use pattern="[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}T[0-9]{2}:[0-9]{2}" 	// for internet explorer where this might not work
			- advised to use and date and time as separate picker

	- <input type = "email">
		- use multiple attribute to get multiple email id's separated by commas
			- when multiple attribute is used, even if no no email is entered, it is completely valid
		- either empty, OR  abc@xyz
		- use <input type = "email" pattern = ".+@gmail\.com">
		- use title attribute around  your input element, so when mouse hovers over it, it gives xtra info about the input type 
		- apparently we can also use placeholder = "123-456-789" for showing something in light grey color in input field
		- a readonly attribute can be used, when we want user to enter data once, or don't allow to enter until a period of time	
			- mostly implemented using javascript
		- maxlength and minlength in "num of characters"
		- use size = "no. of characters" --> to specify the size of the input box

	-  <form action = "mailto:tempmail@gmail.com" method="post" enctype="text/plain" >		// send a mail of name = value type to temp@gmail.com
		-passes the name and value attributes of the form 

	- <datalist> tag, is basically used to recommend some predefined options in input element
	- the list attribute of <input> element must be same as id of <datalist>
		-<datalist id = "temp_id">
			- <option value = "xyz"> ......
		- <input type = "email" list = "temp_id">
	
	
	- <input type = "file">
		 - accept = ".doc, .docx, application/msword"		// accept various file type
		- capture = " "
			- user --> user facing camera or microphone
			- environment --> outward facing camera and/or microphone should be used
			- capture="user" accept="audio/*"
			- capture = "environment" accept = "image/*"
			- capture = "user" accept = "video/*"
				- opens file explorer on pc, but works best in mobile devices

	- <input type = "hidden"
		- basically the value is unseen by user, when the page loads, but using developer tools the value can be edited
			- so don't depend on it for improving security
		
	- <input type = "image">	
		- basically a graphical submit button
		- has similar attributes to <img>
		- < src = "https:xyz.com">
		- < alt = "this is alternative text">
		- Of course need and event handler code

	- < input type = "month"
		- take a month and a year as input
		- YYYY-MM
		- list can be used for suggestion
			- any option in <datalist> that is invaild is not shown in suggestions
		- max and min 
		- readonly
		- step in months 
		- only chrome opera and edge supports it currently

	- <input type = "number"
		- select only numerical value
		- list , max, min, step, placeholder, readonly

	- <input type = "password"
		- hide while entering the password
		- minlength and maxlength
		- pattern is very important 
		- title is very helpful for telling user the numbers and type of characters to enter
		- placeholder can also be very helpful 
		- autocomplete = ""
			- autocomplete = "new-password" --> for sign up form or resetting the password
			- autocomplete = "current-password" --> for sign in form, and browser suggests the previously entered password if any 
			- autcomplete = "on" --> suggesting password
			- autcomplete = "off" --> no suggestion 
		***********************
		- I didn't understood the difference though
		*************************
	

	- <input type = "radio">
	- radio button
	- try to write all the buttons inside fieldset element
	- <Input type = "radio" name = "common_name" value = "radion_button1" >
	- <input type = "radio" name = "common_name" value = "radio_button2" >
	- same name different value
	- when all are uncheked nothing is sent to the server
	- use label to name the radio buttons
	- if no value is written then name = "on" will be transmitted to the server
	- checked is used to make the button by default checked
	- if more than one radio button is applied the attribute "checked "then the last radio button is checked finally
		- this is because the upcoming checked radio buttons unchecks the previous radio button 


	- <input type = "range">
		- basically allows user to enter a value using a sliding bar
		- the exact value isn't shown to user, but it is recorded
		 -Do not use for accurate input taking 
		- max = "10" 		// default is 100
		- min = "2"		// default is 0
		- step = "3" 		// slider will move 3 steps
			- step = "any" means we don't care about the exact stepping 
			- a continous movement of slider 
		- value = "18" 		// the starting position of the slider
			- default value is average of min and max (i.e. midway between min and max)j
		- list can also be used // strange****
		- e.g. volume, brightness, transparency, visibility in gaming, length for password
		- using hash marks on range button
			- list = "hash_marks"
			- <datalist id = "hash_marks">
				- <option value = "10" label = "10%"	// currently no browser supports label 

	- <input type = "reset">
		- to reset the entire form
		- value = "To be displayed on the button"
		- try to avoid it, bcoz its just gonna frustrate user who click it by mistake

	- <input type = "search">
		- to search something ofcourse
		- difference between textfield and this is cross button to clear the search area
			- can also use 'esc' to clear the search area
		- generally we do not provide label for search bar, right? We generally use icons for this purpose
			- instead use placeholder
			- this created problem for screen reader
			- to solve this problem 
		- minlength, maxlength, size, pattern, list, autocorrect["on" (or) "off"](based on previous inputs or browser stored)
		- <form role = " this is a search form">	// learn more about this on wai-aria
			- <input type = "..." aria-label = "this text will be read by screen reader">
			- non visual equivalent to label 
		- spellcheck(underline invaild words with red) 
			- spellcheck = "true" (or) "false"
		- < ... incremental >
			- allows real time updation of search recommendation
			- otherwise user needs to press enter key explicitly for searching
		- <... autcomplete = "on" (or) "off"
			- browser can autocorrect based on previous inputs
			- there are lot of other values that it can take(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete)
	
	- <input type = "tel">
		- similar to "text" but can be useful for mobile users
		- value, list, maxlength, minlength, pattern, placeholder

	- <input type = "text">
		- list, maxlength, minlength, pattern, placeholder, size, readonly, spellcheck, autocorrect

	
	- <input type = "time"
		- value = "hh:mm"
		- from 14:00 to 1:00 means time runs from 2:00pm to 1:00 (i.e. in circular pattern)
		- list, max, min, step in seconds (default is 60s or 1 minute), 

	- <input type = "url">	
		- just verifies the site 
			- abc + '://' + xyz
			- abc.com || abc.in || abc.gov || abc.org (that is the valid domain names) 
		- list, maxlength, minlenght, size, pattern, spellchedk = "true" || "false" 

	- <input type = "week">
		- from week 1 to 52 (or) 53
		- value = "2017-W22"
		- max, min, step ( default value = 1 week) 

	- <input type = "datetime"
		- Most browsers most probabl removed it 

	- <input type = "submit">
		-  does the same job as <button type = "submit"
		- but similar to <input type = "button"> it doesn't have rendering capabilities



	- <link> : The external resource link element
		- The <link> HTML element specifies relationships between the current document and an external resource
		- mostly to link stylesheets and favicons (rel = "stylesheets", rel = "icon" )

	- the rel attribute defines the type of relationship between a linked resource and current document
		- can be used on <link>, <a>, <area>, <form>
		- the value of rel must be present in one of the 
			-  IANA link relation registry 
			-  HTML Living Standard
			-  existing-rel-values page
		- if value is not from above w3c validator will generate a warning
		- e.g. alternate, author, icon, license, stylesheet, etc.  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel
		- combination can also be used ( separated by whitespace0
			- <link rel = "alternate stylesheet" href = "other-file.css" title = "high-contrast">

- all html attribute values are case insensitive


- Object element designed to embed plugins

- <section> 
	- basically to divide our page into sections (heading, introduction, contact me, etc)

- <article>
	- to write article on something and it can be moved from one website to another 


- <header> for some introductory content

- <footer> 
	- authorship info, contact me info, copyright info, back to top ,etc
	- can have more than one footer

- <figure> 
	- for associating a photo, illustration 
	- and <figcaption> for captioning that 
- <meter> for showing low and high as color of red or green

- <progress>
	- just same as meter 

- <video controls>
	- <source src = "source of the video">

- <audio controls>
	- source src = "source of the audio" type = "audio.mp3">

- <iframe src = "youtube embeded link" width and height is something>

    <svg>
        <circle cx = "50" cy = "50" r  = "40" stroke = "rebeccapurple" stroke-width = "10" fill = "pink"></circle>
